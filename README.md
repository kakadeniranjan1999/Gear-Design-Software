# Gear-Design-Software
When designing a mechanical element for desired application, it is important to decide the suitable values of the parameters involved in design procedure.This procedure becomes complex and sometimes hectic to follow. ⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️ As a part of Design of Machine Elements-II (DME-2) practical, designed and developed a desktop application in Python for spur, helical and bevel gear design which estimates the suitable module for the required input parameters and further calculates the gear parameters.
